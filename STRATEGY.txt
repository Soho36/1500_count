First of all you make 1500 evaluations with higher risk of blowup, lets say premarket 2 contracts.
Then 1500 PA with lowest possible risk, lets say premarket 1 contract (meanwhile making for more evaluations).
Each new PA we trade at minimal risk as above.
Then for each PA trailing DD eventually stops and we get much better DD metrix and risk of blowing lowers.
